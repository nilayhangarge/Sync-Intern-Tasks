OTP Verification using Python

Description:
- OTP Verification is the process of verifying a user by sending a unique password so that the user can be verified before completing a registration or payment process. 
- Most of the time, we get an OTP when we make an online payment, or when we forget our password, or when creating an account on any online platform. 
- Thus, the sole purpose of an OTP is to verify the identity of a user by sending a unique password. 
- We can easily create an application for the task of OTP verification using Python by following the steps mentioned below: 
    1.First, create a 6-digit random number. 
    2.Then store the number in a variable 
    3.Then we need to write a program to send emails.
    4. When sending email, we need to use OTP as a message.
    5. Finally, we need to request two user inputs; first for the userâ€™s email and then for the OTP that the user has received. 
- So this is the complete process of creating an OTP verification application using Python.

NOTE:
- Don't put your original gmail account password on line 7 of my Python code because it violates privacy. 
- Rather, adhere to these steps:
    1) Select "Manage your Google Accounts" 
    2) Select Security > Enable multi-factor authentication.
    3) Next, search for the app's password 
    4) Select Other by clicking Select App.
    5) Create a personalised name using any phrase you like. 
    6) Paste the created password into the code at this point.
- Also, modify your email and password when uploading your work to any arbitrary platform (such as GitHub).
